  abstract     = {Cloud computing offers utility-oriented IT services to users worldwide. Based on a pay-as-you-go model, it enables hosting of pervasive applications from consumer, scientific, and business domains. However, data centers hosting Cloud applications consume huge amounts of electrical energy, contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. Therefore, we need Green Cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact. In this paper, we define an architectural framework and principles for energy-efficient Cloud computing. Based on this architecture, we present our vision, open research challenges, and resource provisioning and allocation algorithms for energy-efficient management of Cloud computing environments. The proposed energy-aware allocation heuristics provision data center resources to client applications in a way that improves energy efficiency of the data center, while delivering the negotiated Quality of Service (QoS). In particular, in this paper we conduct a survey of research in energy-efficient computing and propose: (a) architectural principles for energy-efficient management of Clouds; (b) energy-efficient resource allocation policies and scheduling algorithms considering QoS expectations and power usage characteristics of the devices; and (c) a number of open research challenges, addressing which can bring substantial benefits to both resource providers and consumers. We have validated our approach by conducting a performance evaluation study using the CloudSim toolkit. The results demonstrate that Cloud computing model has immense potential as it offers significant cost savings and demonstrates high potential for the improvement of energy efficiency under dynamic workload scenarios.},

  abstract   = {Cloud computing has recently emerged as a subject of substantial industrial and academic interest, though its meaning and scope is hotly debated. For some researchers, clouds are a natural evolution towards the full commercialisation of grid systems, while others dismiss the term as a mere re-branding of existing pay-per-use technologies. From either perspective, "cloud" is now the label of choice for accountable pay-per-use access to third party applications and computational resources on a massive scale. Clouds support patterns of less predictable resource use for applications and services across the IT spectrum, from online office applications to high-throughput transactional services and high-performance computations involving substantial quantities of processing cycles and storage. The concept of clouds seems to blur the distinctions between a variety of technologies that encompass grid services, web services and data centres, and leads to considerations of lowered-cost provisioning for bursty applications.  This book provides comprehensive coverage of the state of the art in cloud computing, highlighting and clarifying the conceptual and systemic links with other distributed computing approaches.},

  abstract   = {Cloud computing is novel technology, which enables any resource as service on demand. Cloud environment motivates highly dynamic resource provisioning. Hence clients can scale up or scale down their requirements as per their demand. Load balancing is very important and complex problem in cloud environment, because of its heterogeneity of the computing nodes. In order to realize the full potential of cloud computing it is vital to minimize energy consumption along with effective load balancing. The aim of Energy Aware Load Balancing (EALB) model is to minimize energy consumption with load balancing. EALB model classifies the incoming job request either CPU bound or I/O bound according to their purpose and behaviour. This classification details are maintained in a table named Pattern History Table (PHT) and organized as hash table. One of the virtual machine (VM) is selected dynamically based on best fit allocation policy and the job is assigned to the victimized VM. From the pattern history table job's nature is identified. Using Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) scheme the selected VM's processor clock frequency is increased if it is found CPU bound else decreased (I/O bound). Thus, EALB algorithm saves considerable amount of energy and proves to be more efficient.},

  abstract   = {Workload and resource management are two essential functions provided at the service level of the distributed systems infrastructure. To improve the global throughput of these software environments, workloads have to be evenly scheduled among the available resources. To realize this goal, several load balancing strategies and algorithms have been proposed. Most o f t h e s e strategies were developed assuming homogeneous set of sites linked with homogeneous and fast networks. However, for computational grids, we must address some new issues, namely: heterogeneity, scalability and adaptability. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cluster-based algorithm which achieves dynamic load balancing in the cloud architecture. The proposed algorithm presents the following main features: (i) it supports heterogeneity, (ii) scalability, (iii) low network congestion and (iv) absence of any bottleneck node due to its decentralized nature. Simulation results using CloudSim show the performance analysis of the algorithm for patronizing our claims about the load balancing achieved in the system.},

Several recent papers have tried to address the issue of improving energy efficiency in allocating cloud resources to applications with varying degree of success. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no published literature on this subject that clearly articulates the research problem and provides research taxonomy for succinct classification of existing techniques. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to identify open challenges associated with energy efficient resource allocation. In this regard, the study, first, outlines the problem and existing hardware and software-based techniques available for this purpose. Furthermore, available techniques already presented in the literature are summarized based on the energy-efficient research dimension taxonomy. The advantages and disadvantages of the existing techniques are comprehensively analyzed against the proposed research dimension taxonomy namely: resource adaption policy, objective function, allocation method, allocation operation, and interoperability.},

  abstract     = {We propose in this paper to study the energy-, thermal- and performance-aware resource management in heterogeneous datacenters. Witnessing the continuous development of heterogeneity in datacenters, we are confronted with their different behaviors in terms of performance, power consumption and thermal dissipation: Indeed, heterogeneity at server level lies both in the computing infrastructure (computing power, electrical power consumption) and in the heat removal systems (different enclosure, fans, thermal sinks). Also the physical locations of the servers become important with heterogeneity since some servers can (over)heat others. While many studies address independently these parameters (most of the time performance and power or energy), we show in this paper the necessity to tackle all these aspects for an optimal resource management of the computing resources. This leads to improved energy usage in a heterogeneous datacenter including the cooling of the computer rooms. We build our approach on the concept of heat distribution matrix to handle the mutual influence of the servers, in heterogeneous environments, which is novel in this context. We propose a heuristic to solve the server placement problem and we design a generic greedy framework for the online scheduling problem. We derive several single-objective heuristics (for performance, energy, cooling) and a novel fuzzy-based priority mechanism to handle their tradeoffs. Finally, we show results using extensive simulations fed with actual measurements on heterogeneous servers.},

In 2014, data centers in the U.S. consumed an estimated 70 billion kWh, representing about 1.8% of total U.S. electricity consumption. This report shows that data center electricity consumption increased by about 4% from 2010-2014, a large shift from the 24% percent increase estimated from 2005-2010 and the nearly 90% increase estimated from 2000-2005. Energy use is expected to continue slightly increasing in the near future, increasing 4% from 2014-2020, the same rate as the past five years. Based on current trend estimates, U.S. data centers are projected to consume approximately 73 billion kWh in 2020. A combination of efficiency trends has resulted in a relatively steady U.S data center electricity demand over the past 5 years, with little growth expected for the remainder of this decade. Along with the energy efficiency resource already achieved, there are additional energy efficiency strategies and technologies that could significantly reduce data center electricity use below the approximately 73 billion kWh demand projected in 2020. Many of these efficiency strategies are already successfully employed in some data centers while others are emerging technologies that will be commercially available in the near future. The potential impact from an adoption of additional energy efficiency strategies is explored, which estimate an annual saving in 2020 up to 33 billion kWh, representing a 45% reduction in electricity demand when compared to current efficiency trends.textless/ptextgreater},

The proposed solution deals with ISO 50001 implementation which represents a critical challenge for many companies because the benefits due to improvements in energy management could be potentially canceled by the costs of an Energy Management System (EnMS). In particular, the Key Performance Indexes (KPIs) monitoring is a crucial activity for several reasons: it is one of the early activities, it affects the measurement quality of KPIs and it deeply impacts the EnMS requirements and, consequently, the investment valuations. The proposed strategy supports the energy managers in the design of the energy monitoring system suggesting the points of the electrical network to be equipped with sensors and monitored. Moreover, the paper describes the results carried out in a real-world application: the energy sensor network of a 1.2MW flour mill plant sited in Italy has been designed and implemented with the proposed innovative solution.},

Thermal management of data centers can address dominant problems associated with cooling such as the recirculation of hot air from the equipment outlets to their inlets and the appearance of hot spots. In this paper, we show through formalization that minimizing the peak inlet temperature allows for the lowest cooling power needs. Using a low-complexity linear heat recirculation model, we define the problem of minimizing the peak inlet temperature within a data center through task assignment (MPIT-TA), consequently leading to minimal cooling-requirement. We also provide two methods to solve the formulation: Xlnt-GA, which uses a genetic algorithm, and Xlnt-SQP, which uses sequential quadratic programming. Results from small-scale data center simulations show that solving the formulation leads to an inlet temperature distribution that, compared to other approaches, is 2 degC to 5 degC lower and achieves about 20 to 30 percent cooling energy savings at common data center utilization rates. Moreover, our algorithms consistently outperform the minimize heat recirculation algorithm, a recirculation-reducing task placement algorithm in the literature.},

  abstract   = {Scalable, high performance, and fault-tolerant distributed applications are realized with virtual machines in server cluster systems. Application processes are performed on virtual machines in each server. Processing load of virtual machines to perform application processes has to be balanced in a server cluster system to satisfy the application requirements like response time. On the other hand, a server cluster system consumes a large amount of electric energy since multiple servers consume electric energy to perform application processes. It is critical to discuss how to reduce the total electric energy consumption of a server cluster to perform application processes on virtual machines. In our previous studies, the transmission model and power consumption model of a server to perform communication processes on multiple virtual machines are proposed. In this paper, we newly propose the transmission energy consumption laxity based (TECLB) algorithm to allocate communication processes to virtual machines in a server cluster based on the proposed transmission model and power consumption model of a server so that the total energy consumption of a server cluster can be reduced. We evaluate the TECLB algorithm in terms of the total energy consumption of a server cluster and transmission time of each process compared with the basic round-robin (RR) algorithm. The evaluation results show the average total energy consumption of a server cluster is maximumly reduced to 9% of the RR algorithm.},

  abstract   = {Cloud computing is emerging as a new paradigm of large-scale distributed computing. In order to utilize the power of cloud computing completely, we need an efficient task scheduling algorithm. The traditional Min-Min algorithm is a simple, efficient algorithm that produces a better schedule that minimizes the total completion time of tasks than other algorithms in the literature [7]. However the biggest drawback of it is load imbalanced, which is one of the central issues for cloud providers. In this paper, an improved load balanced algorithm is introduced on the ground of Min-Min algorithm in order to reduce the makespan and increase the resource utilization (LBIMM). At the same time, Cloud providers offer computer resources to users on a pay-per-use base. In order to accommodate the demands of different users, they may offer different levels of quality for services. Then the cost per resource unit depends on the services selected by the user. In return, the user receives guarantees regarding the provided resources. To observe the promised guarantees, user-priority was considered in our proposed PA-LBIMM so that user's demand could be satisfied more completely. At last, the introduced algorithm is simulated using Matlab toolbox. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm can lead to significant performance gain and achieve over 20% improvement on both VIP user satisfaction and resource utilization ratio.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of cloud computing based on virtualization technologies brings huge opportunities to host virtual resource at low cost without the need of owning any infrastructure. Virtualization technologies enable users to acquire, configure and be charged on pay-per-use basis. However, Cloud data centers mostly comprise heterogeneous commodity servers hosting multiple virtual machines (VMs) with potential various specifications and fluctuating resource usages, which may cause imbalanced resource utilization within servers that may lead to performance degradation and service level agreements (SLAs) violations. To achieve efficient scheduling, these challenges should be addressed and solved by using load balancing strategies, which have been proved to be NP-hard problem. From multiple perspectives, this work identifies the challenges and analyzes existing algorithms for allocating VMs to PMs in infrastructure Clouds, especially focuses on load balancing. A detailed classification targeting load balancing algorithms for VM placement in cloud data centers is investigated and the surveyed algorithms are classified according to the classification. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and comparative understanding of existing literature and aid researchers by providing an insight for potential future enhancements.},

Inherently, a resource allocation strategy that takes into account resource utilization would lead to a better energy efficiency; this, in clouds, extends further with virtualization technologies in that tasks can be easily consolidated. Task consolidation is an effective method to increase resource utilization and in turn reduces energy consumption. Recent studies identified that server energy consumption scales linearly with (processor) resource utilization. This encouraging fact further highlights the significant contribution of task consolidation to the reduction in energy consumption. However, task consolidation can also lead to the freeing up of resources that can sit idling yet still drawing power. There have been some notable efforts to reduce idle power draw, typically by putting computer resources into some form of sleep/power-saving mode. In this paper, we present two energy-conscious task consolidation heuristics, which aim to maximize resource utilization and explicitly take into account both active and idle energy consumption. Our heuristics assign each task to the resource on which the energy consumption for executing the task is explicitly or implicitly minimized without the performance degradation of that task. Based on our experimental results, our heuristics demonstrate their promising energy-saving capability.},

  abstract     = {The energy demand for operating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems has been growing, implying in high operational costs and consequent increase of carbon emissions. Both in datacenters and telecom infrastructures, the networks represent a significant amount of energy spending. Given that, there is an increased demand for energy efficiency solutions, and several capabilities to save energy have been proposed. However, it is very difficult to orchestrate such energy efficiency capabilities, that is, coordinate or combine them in the same network, ensuring a conflict-free operation and choosing the best one for a given scenario, ensuring that a capability not suited to the current bandwidth utilization will not be applied and lead to congestion or packet loss. There is neither a way to do this taking business directives into account. In this regard, a method able to orchestrate different energy efficiency capabilities is proposed considering the possible combinations and conflicts among them, as well as the best option for a given workload and network characteristics. The business policies are refined down to the network level in order to bring high-level directives into the operation, and a Utility Function is used to combine energy efficiency and performance requirements. A Decision Tree able to determine what to do in each scenario is deployed in a Software Defined Network environment. The proposed method was validated with different experiments, testing the Utility Function, checking the extra savings when combining several capabilities, the decision tree interpolation and dynamicity aspects. The orchestration proved valid to solve the problem of finding the best combination for a given scenario, achieving additional savings due to the combination, besides ensuring a conflict-free operation.

  abstract     = {Virtualized datacenters and clouds are being increasingly considered for traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads that have typically targeted Grids and conventional HPC platforms. However, maximizing energy efficiency and utilization of datacenter resources, and minimizing undesired thermal behavior while ensuring application performance and other Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for HPC applications requires careful consideration of important and extremely challenging tradeoffs. Virtual Machine (VM) migration is one of the most common techniques used to alleviate thermal anomalies (i.e., hotspots) in cloud datacenter servers as it reduces load and, hence, the server utilization. In this article, the benefits of using other techniques such as voltage scaling and pinning (traditionally used for reducing energy consumption) for thermal management over VM migrations are studied in detail. As no single technique is the most efficient to meet temperature/performance optimization goals in all situations, an autonomic approach that performs energy-efficient thermal management while ensuring the QoS delivered to the users is proposed. To address the problem of VM allocation that arises during VM migrations, an innovative application-centric energy-aware strategy for Virtual Machine (VM) allocation is proposed. The proposed strategy ensures high resource utilization and energy efficiency through VM consolidation while satisfying application QoS by exploiting knowledge obtained through application profiling along multiple dimensions (CPU, memory, and network bandwidth utilization). To support our arguments, we present the results obtained from an experimental evaluation on real hardware using HPC workloads under different scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Virtualization is one of the key technologies that enable Cloud Computing, a novel computing paradigm aiming at provisioning on-demand computing capacities as services. With the special features of self-service and pay-as-you-use, Cloud Computing is attracting not only personal users but also small and middle enterprises. By running applications on the Cloud, users need not maintain their own servers thus to save administration cost. Cloud Computing uses a business model meaning that the operation overhead must be a major concern of the Cloud providers. Today, the payment of a data centre on energy may be larger than the overall investment on the computing, storage and network facilities. Therefore, saving energy consumption is a hot topic not only in Cloud Computing but also for other domains. This work proposes and implements a virtual machine (VM) scheduling mechanism that targets on both load-balancing and temperature-balancing with a final goal of reducing the energy consumption in a Cloud centre. Using the strategy of VM migration it is ensured that none of the physical hosts suffers from either high temperature or over-utilization. The proposed scheduling mechanism has been evaluated on CloudSim, a well-known simulator for Cloud Computing. Initial experimental results show a significant benefit in terms of energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Cloud computing has been emerging as the next big revolution in both computer networks and Web provisioning. Because of raised expectations, several vendors, such as Amazon and IBM, started designing, developing, and deploying Cloud solutions to optimize the usage of their own data centers, and some open-source solutions are also underway, such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack. Cloud architectures exploit virtualization techniques to provision multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on the same physical host, so as to efficiently use available resources, for instance, to consolidate VMs in the minimal number of physical servers to reduce the runtime power consumption. VM consolidation has to carefully consider the aggregated resource consumption of co-located VMs, in order to avoid performance reductions and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. While various works have already treated the VM consolidation problem from a theoretical perspective, this paper focuses on it from a more practical viewpoint, with specific attention on the consolidation aspects related to power, CPU, and networking resource sharing. Moreover, the paper proposes a Cloud management platform to optimize VM consolidation along three main dimensions, namely power consumption, host resources, and networking. Reported experimental results point out that interferences between co-located VMs have to be carefully considered to avoid placement solutions that, although being feasible from a more theoretical viewpoint, cannot ensure VM provisioning with SLA guarantees.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth in demand for computational power driven by modern service applications combined with the shift to the Cloud computing model have led to the establishment of large-scale virtualized data centers. Such data centers consume enormous amounts of electrical energy resulting in high operating costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) using live migration and switching idle nodes to the sleep mode allows Cloud providers to optimize resource usage and reduce energy consumption. However, the obligation of providing high quality of service to customers leads to the necessity in dealing with the energy-performance trade-off, as aggressive consolidation may lead to performance degradation. Because of the variability of workloads experienced by modern applications, the VM placement should be optimized continuously in an online manner. To understand the implications of the online nature of the problem, we conduct a competitive analysis and prove competitive ratios of optimal online deterministic algorithms for the single VM migration and dynamic VM consolidation problems. Furthermore, we propose novel adaptive heuristics for dynamic consolidation of VMs based on an analysis of historical data from the resource usage by VMs. The proposed algorithms significantly reduce energy consumption, while ensuring a high level of adherence to the service level agreement. We validate the high efficiency of the proposed algorithms by extensive simulations using real-world workload traces from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Global need of computing is growing day by day and as a result cloud based services are getting more prominent for its pay-as-you-go modality. However, cloud based datacenters consume considerable amount of energy which draws negative attention. To sustain the growth of cloud computing, energy consumption is now a major concern for cloud based datacenters. To overcome this problem, cloud computing algorithm should be efficient enough to keep energy consumption low and at the same time provide desired QoS. Virtual machine consolidation is one such technique to ensure energy-QoS balance. In this research, we explored Fuzzy logic and heuristic based virtual machine consolidation approach to achieve energy-QoS balance. Fuzzy VM selection method has been proposed to select VM from an overloaded host. Additionally, we incorporated migration control in Fuzzy VM selection method. We have used CloudSim toolkit to simulate our experiment and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on real-world work load traces of PlanetLab VMs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides best performance in all performance metrics while consuming least energy.},

IaaS enables datacenter’s hardware to get virtualized which allows Cloud providers to create multiple Virtual Machine (VM) instances on a single physical machine, thus improving resource utilization and increasing the Return on Investment (ROI). VM consolidation includes issues like choosing appropriate algorithm for selection of VMs for migration and placement of VMs to suitable hosts. VMs need to be migrated from overutilized host to guarantee that demand for computer resources and performance requirements are accomplished. Besides, they need to be migrated from underutilized host to deactivate that host for saving power consumption. In order to solve the problem of energy and performance, efficient dynamic VM consolidation approach is introduced in literature. In this work, we have proposed multiple redesigned VM placement algorithms and introduced a technique by clustering VMs to migrate by taking account both CPU utilization and allocated RAM.

Virtualization techniques improve the efficiency of data centers infrastructure sharing a same physical hardware among several Virtual Machines (VMs). An efficient VM placement can minimize even further the hardware and energy needs. In contrast to existing VM placement algorithms that usually focus on a single resource or assumes that resources demands are deterministic, this paper proposes and compares four energy-aware algorithms that consider multiple stochastic resources, including network bandwidth. We first formulate the problem as a multi objective optimization problem with stochastic resources and we present two algorithms based on this approach. We also formulate the problem as an evolutionary computation problem and we present two algorithms based on this approach. The objective is a joint strategy: minimize the required hardware to maximize the allocated VMs satisfying the resource requirements. Through simulations, we compare our algorithms using real VMs workloads from the PlanetLab project and showed the significant improvements on power consumption and network utilization. In average, the algorithms reduce power consumption by 87.90% and the network utilization by 9.94%.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of cloud-based services that are offered in software as a service (SaaS) models by SaaS providers, and irregular access of different users to these cloud services leads to fluctuations in the demand workload. It is difficult to determine the suitable amount of resources required to run cloud services in response to the varying workloads, and this may lead to undesirable states of over-provisioning and under-provisioning. In this paper, we address improvements to resource provisioning for cloud services by proposing an autonomic resource provisioning approach that is based on the concept of the control monitor-analyze-plan-execute (MAPE) loop, and we design a resource provisioning framework for cloud environments. The experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces the total cost by up to 35  the number of service level agreement (SLA) violations by up to 40  and increases the resource utilization by up to 25 % compared with the other approaches.},

  abstract     = {To meet the increasing demand of computational power, at present IT service providers’ should choose cloud based services for its flexibility, reliability and scalability. More and more datacenters are being built to cater customers’ need. However, the datacenters consume large amounts of energy, and this draws negative attention. To address those issues, researchers propose energy efficient algorithms that can minimize energy consumption while keeping the quality of service (QoS) at a satisfactory level. Virtual Machine consolidation is one such technique to ensure energy-QoS balance. In this research, we explore fuzzy logic and heuristic based virtual machine consolidation approach to achieve energy-QoS balance. A Fuzzy VM selection method is proposed in this research. It selects VM from an overloaded host. Additionally, we incorporate migration control in Fuzzy VM selection method that will enhance the performance of the selection strategy. A new overload detection algorithm has also been proposed based on mean, median and standard deviation of utilization of VMs. We have used CloudSim toolkit to simulate our experiment and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on real-world work load traces of Planet lab VMs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is most energy efficient compared to others.},

  abstract     = {The electricity cost of cloud computing data centers, dominated by server power and cooling power, is growing rapidly. To tackle this problem, inlet air with moderate temperature and server consolidation are widely adopted. However, the benefit of these two methods is limited due to conventional air cooling system ineffectiveness caused by recirculation and low heat capacity. To address this problem, hybrid air and liquid cooling, as a practical and inexpensive approach, has been introduced. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the impact of server consolidation and temperature of cooling water on the total electricity and server maintenance costs in hybrid cooling data centers. To minimize the total costs, we proposed to maintain sweet temperature and available sleeping time threshold (ASTT) by which a joint cost optimization can be satisfied. By using real-world traces, the potential savings of sweet temperature and ASTT are estimated to be average 23% of the total cost, while 96% requests are satisfied compared to a strategy which only reduces electricity cost. The co-optimization is extended to increase the benefit of the renewable energy, and its profit grows as more wind power is supplied.},

The model is applied to estimate 2008 U.S. data center electricity demand and the technical potential for electricity savings associated with major measures for IT devices and infrastructure equipment. Results suggest that 2008 demand was approximately 69 billion kilowatt hours (1.8% of 2008 total U.S. electricity sales) and that it may be technically feasible to reduce this demand by up to 80% (to 13 billion kilowatt hours) through aggressive pursuit of energy efficiency measures. Measure-level savings estimates are provided, which shed light on the relative importance of different measures at the national level.

  abstract  = {A data center is a facility used to keep computer related equipments. It is estimated that heat production rate of the data center is doubled in every two years and hence the inevitability of the cooling system gets increased. In due course power consumption of a data center is augmented and more cost is spent on the power usage of the cooling system rather than the equipment purchase. As a result power savings for the cooling system is strongly desired. In this paper we conferred two primary free cooling systems namely air economizer and water economizer. A free cooling economizer system uses the outside air which is forced to the data center when outside climate is suitable to meet the ASHRE's cooling requirements. We have also conducted a survey and simulation based estimation using TRACE[TM] Chiller Plant Analyzer Tool. In this study, the energy consumption in a data center using conventional cooling system is compared with Air Economizer and Water Economizer for three different Zones namely Chicago, Atlanta and Phoenix in view of the fact that the outside air is relatively cool most of the year. From the projected result it is observed that both economizers reduce energy and cost when compared with conventional system and the usage of Economizer permits the chiller to shut down or reduce chiller energy load under suitable weather conditions. The results show that Water economizers are shown to consistently outperform air economizer which provides significant improvement in cooling system efficiency and cost at data center. The performance ratio of the conventional, air economizer and the water economizers are 50 76% and 79% respectively that shows economizers provide more savings relative to the conventional system.},

To keep pace with modern computing needs, data centers continue to grow in scale and consume increasing amounts of power. While prior work on data centers has led to significant improvements in their energy-efficiency, detailed measurements from these facilities' operations are not widely available, as data center design is often considered part of a company's competitive advantage. However, such detailed measurements are critical to the research community in motivating and evaluating new energy-efficiency optimizations. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of a state-of-the-art 15MW green multi-tenant data center that incorporates many of the technological advances used in commercial data centers. We analyze the data center's computing load and its impact on power, water, and carbon usage using standard effectiveness metrics, including PUE, WUE, and CUE. Our results reveal the benefits of optimizations, such as free cooling, and provide insights into how the various effectiveness metrics change with the seasons and increasing capacity usage. More broadly, our PUE, WUE, and CUE analysis validate the green design of this LEED Platinum data center.},

Modular data center, which is often packaged in standard shipping formats, has been introduced to construct and deploy data centers more quickly and less expensively than conventional data centers. To conserve cooling costs in modular data centers, a hot aisle/cold aisle arrangement of the IT racks is employed by dividing the top of the racks using the partition. However, dividing the top of the racks increases the pressure loss of the server fans, leading to the increase of the server fan power. To examine the impact of this effect on annual cooling power, we perform simulations of power consumption in modular data center that introduces outside air and louvers on the top of the racks. By varying the opening of the louver as a function of the outside air temperature and rack power, an operation to minimize the power consumption of the outside air fans and server fans is performed. We find that total cooling power in case where the louver is operated so as to minimize the total cooling power can be reduced than that in case where the louver is fully closed by about 5% (10 for 10kW (20kW) rack power. We discuss that the popular method for calculating energy efficiency in data centers, i.e. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), defined by the ratio of total amount of energy used to the energy used in IT equipment, is probably incomplete metric. Therefore, we finally propose that a revised PUE that removes the server fan power from IT equipment energy, and it should be used to estimate the energy efficiency to avoid the wrong interpretation.},

  abstract   = {Fifty-seven percent of US servers are housed in server closets, server rooms, and localized data centers, in what are commonly referred to as small server rooms, which comprise 99textbackslash% of all server spaces in the US. While many mid-tier and enterprise-class data centers are owned by large corporations that consider energy efficiency a goal to minimize business operating costs, small server rooms typically are not similarly motivated. They are characterized by decentralized ownership and management and come in many configurations, which creates a unique set of efficiency challenges. To develop energy efficiency strategies for these spaces, we surveyed 30 small server rooms across eight institutions, and selected four of them for detailed assessments. The four rooms had Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) values ranging from 1.5 to 2.1. Energy saving opportunities ranged from no- to low-cost measures such as raising cooling set points and better airflow management, to more involved but cost-effective measures including server consolidation and virtualization, and dedicated cooling with economizers. We found that inefficiencies mainly resulted from organizational rather than technical issues. Because of the inherent space and resource limitations, the most effective measure is to operate servers through energy-efficient cloud-based services or well-managed larger data centers, rather than server rooms. Backup power requirement, and IT and cooling efficiency should be evaluated to minimize energy waste in the server space. Utility programs are instrumental in raising awareness and spreading technical knowledge on server operation, and the implementation of energy efficiency measures in small server rooms.},

Por esta razón, reduciendo el costo de la construcción y el aumento de la eficiencia energética (y por lo tanto la reducción de la huella de carbono) de los centros de datos ha sido uno de los temas más candentes de investigación en los últimos años.

Efforts have been made to reduce the energy clouds consume, with certain data centres now approaching a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) factor of 1.08. While this is an incredible mark, it also means that the IT infrastructure accounts for a large part of the power consumed by a data centre. Hence, means to monitor and analyse how energy is spent have never been so crucial. Such monitoring is required not only for understanding how power is consumed, but also for assessing the impact of energy management policies. In this article, we draw lessons from experience on monitoring large-scale systems and introduce an energy monitoring software framework called Kilo Watt API (KWAPI), able to handle Open-Stack clouds. The framework - whose architecture is scalable, extensible, and completely integrated into Open Stack - supports several wattmeter devices, multiple measurement formats, and minimises communication overhead.},

This report assesses current trends in energy use and energy costs of data centers and servers in the U.S. (especially Federal government facilities) and outlines existing and emerging opportunities fo improved energy efficiency. It also makes recommendations for pursuing these energy-efficiency opportunities broadly across the country though the use of information and incentive-based programs.
Findings from this report include:An estimate that data centers consumed about 61 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2006, roughly 1.5% of total U.S. electricity consumption, or about 4.5 billion in electricity costs.Federal servers and data centers alone account for approximately 6 billion kWh (10 of this electricity consumption, or about 4.5 billion in electricity costs.Assuming current trends continue, in 5 years the national energy consumption by servers and data centers is expected to nearly double, to nearly 100 billion kWh.Existing technologies and strategies could reduce typical server energy use by an estimated 25% - even greater energy savings are possible with advanced technologies.Assuming state-of-the-art energy efficiency practices are implemented throughout U.S. data centers, this projected energy use can be reduced by up to 55% compared to current efficiency trends.
This report makes several recommendations for policies to achieve this savings potential. Among these recommendations are standarized permormance measurement for data centers and their equipment, leadership on energy efficiency in federal data centers, a private sector energy challenge, information on best practices, and further research and development on energy efficiency technologies and practices.},

  abstract    = {Data centers form the underpinnings of the global technology revolution that is cloud computing. There is enormous pressure for data center growth and expansion, to meet the computational demands of an increasingly digital world. With energy costs overtaking server costs in data centers, energy is fast becoming a significant bottleneck to data center scale-out. Further, the global data center energy footprint is growing to be a significant burden on the world’s energy resources. Yet energy is a signally ill-managed resource in most data centers; average data center energy efficiency is less than 50%. With increasing industry awareness of the magnitude and urgency of this problem, many solutions are cropping up to combat each of the several sources of data center energy inefficiency. 
	The objective of this dissertation is three-fold: First, we examine the causes of data center energy inefficiency from first principles, and identify the challenges involved in addressing them. We find two categories of energy inefficiency: Idle resource energy consumption, and support infrastructure energy consumption. Second, we present solutions to address each form of inefficiency. We describe two ways to combat idle resource energy consumption, and also present a systemic solution to tackle both forms of energy inefficiency. Finally, throughout this dissertation, we examine the related work and literature, and attempt to map them into the solution space to identify how the solutions relate with each other, and what gaps remain to be addressed. 
	The cloud has the potential to enable everything from ubiquitous computing and universal access to knowledge, to smart power grids, greater social connectivity, and near-infinite extensibility of compute/storage power. The cloud turns computation into a utility, and by doing so, has the potential to make it accessible to a much larger part of the world. This dissertation explores ways to enable sustainable scaling of the data centers that power the cloud and enable this vision.},

One challenge is that PUE does not account for the power distribution and cooling losses inside IT equipment. This is particularly problematic in the HPC (high performance computing) space where system suppliers are moving cooling and power subsystems into or out of the cluster. This paper proposes two new metrics: ITUE (IT-power usage effectiveness), similar to PUE but “inside” the IT and TUE (total-power usage effectiveness), which combines the two for a total efficiency picture. We conclude with a demonstration of the method, and a case study of measurements at ORNL’s Jaguar system. TUE provides a ratio of total energy, (internal and external support energy uses) and the specific energy used in the HPC. TUE can also be a means for comparing HPC site to HPC site.},

The mechanism is envy-free, has a high probability of being truthful, and generates a near optimal profit for the provider. We combine the proposed auction design with a scheme for dynamically calculating reserve prices based on data center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and electricity costs. Our simulation-based evaluation of the mechanism demonstrates its effectiveness under a broad variety of market conditions. In particular, we show how it improves on the classical uniform price auction, and we investigate the value of prior knowledge on the execution time of virtual machines for maximizing profit. We also developed a system prototype and conducted a small-scale experimental study with a group of 10 users that confirms the truthfulness property of the mechanism in a real test environment.},

It also makes recommendations for pursuing these energy-efficiency opportunities broadly across the country though the use of information and incentive-based programs .Findings from this report include:An estimate that data centers consumed about 61 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2006, roughly 1 .5% of total U.S. electricity consumption, or about $4 .5 billion in electricity costs .Federal servers and data centers alone account for approximately 6 billion kWh (10 of this electricity consumption, or about $4 .5 billion in electricity costs .Assuming current trends continue, in 5 years the national energy consumption by servers and data centers is expected to nearly double, to nearly 100 billion kWh .Existing technologies and strategies could reduce typical server energy use by an estimated 25% - even greater energy savings are possible with advanced technologies .Assuming state-of-the-art energy efficiency practices are implemented throughout U.S. data centers, this projected energy use can be reduced by up to 55% compared to current efficiency trends .This report makes several recommendations for policies to achieve this savings potential . Among these recommendations are standarized permormance measurement for data centers and their equipment, leadership on energy efficiency in federal data centers, a private sector energy challenge, information on best practices, and further research and development on energy efficiency technologies and practices .},

The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E.

Numerous current techniques for localisation of sensor nodes use the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from sensor nodes because of its simplicity and cost. Non-linearities in RSSI circuits, the antenna radiation pattern and path loss model parameter estimation may result in accuracy of the localisation algorithm. Therefore, environmental characterisation of radio propagation basic mechanisms is a fundamental step toward the design of ranging and localisation algorithms able to work properly in realistic scenarios. Furthermore, positioning systems are migrating towards hybridisation where data coming from heterogeneous technologies are fused to improve localisation accuracy and coverage. This paper presents an improved mathematical model for ranging using RSSI in realistic practical scenarios as well as measurement methodologies to use during calibration experiments in order to quantify each parameter involved in a localisation algorithm using a sensor data fusion approach.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to develop a better understanding of what drives small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to engage in environmental practices, and whether the drivers differ across types of practices. Two types of environmental practices are distinguished: practices related to production processes (greening processes) and practices related to products and services (greening product and service offerings). Despite a growing literature on socially responsible behavior of large firms, the role of SMEs remains underexposed. This neglect is remarkable given the substantial impact of SMEs on the economy and the natural environment. By using unique data for almost 8,000 SMEs across 12 sectors in 36 countries, we study the influence of firm characteristics on SMEs’ environmental behavior. Our results suggest that different characteristics have dissimilar influences on both types of environmental practices such as the type of customers served. Stringent environmental legislation encourages firms to actively take on environmental activities, but only in case of green products and services. Moreover, the dominant idea that small firms are reluctant to invest in environmental practices is clearly more nuanced: firm size matters most for engagement in greening processes. Finally, SMEs active in tangible sectors and that receive financial support are more involved in either type of environmental practices.},

We propose a sensor data gathering system using a single board computer for home energy management systems. This sensor system should be capable of handling 100 sensor data per second. Since a single board computer has low power consumption and low performance, it is used as the sensor data gathering server. Based on our benchmark evaluation, a single board computer can receive 5000 sensor data per second. Since the basic requirement is only 100 sensor data per second, this single board computer has adequate performance to act as an aggregated server for 50 such sensor data gathering systems.},

This method of bringing in outside air as the primary cooling resource greatly reduces overall facility power by eliminating need for the compressors and pumps required by chilled water and refrigerant based cooling systems. However, system fans are still necessary to supply and move large amounts of air through the facility. The operating power of fans is dependent on the static pressure which must be overcome to move air. The static pressure of a data center is generally fixed for a given configuration, with the exception of air filters which become clogged over time. In this work, airflow versus pressure drop curves of filters removed after eight and a half months of service in a large data center operating an air-side economizer are experimentally characterized. Comparisons of this data against clean filters provides insight into the change in pressure drop of both low-efficiency pleated pre-filters and high-efficiency cartridge final filters as they become dirty. Incorporating these system resistance curves into the power curve of the data center supply fans indicates only minimal increase in energy use resulting from dust and particle collection of the filters.},

In these structures, the massive heat generation of the processor results in a high operating temperature and a high refresh rate of the DRAM. Thus, in the 3D DRAM over processor architecture, temperature-aware refresh management is necessary. However, temperature determination is difficult, because in the 3D DRAM, the temperature changes dynamically and temperature variation in a DRAM die is complicated. In this paper, a thermal guard-band set-up method for the 3D stacked DRAM is proposed. It considers the latency of the temperature data and the position difference between the temperature sensor and the DRAM cell. With this method, the data reliability of the on-chip temperature sensor dependent adaptive refresh control is guaranteed. In addition, an efficient temperature sensor built-in and refresh control method is analyzed. The expected refresh power reduction is examined through a simulation.},

In this paper, a temperature-aware software-based self-testing (SBST) technique is proposed to self-heat the processors within a high temperature range and effectively test delay faults under high temperature. First, it automatically generates high-quality test programs through automatic test instruction generation (ATIG), and avoids over-testing caused by nonfunctional patterns. Second, it exploits two effective powerintensive program transformations to self-heat up the processors internally. Third, it applies a greedy algorithm to search the optimized schedule of the test templates in order to generate the test program while making sure that the temperature of the processor under test is within the specified range. Experimental results show that the generated program is successful to guarantee delay test within the given temperature range, and achieves high test performance with functional patterns.},

  abstract     = {The demand for and on data centers continue to pose several power, cooling, and performance constraints associated with operational, economic and environmental inefficiency. Sensor Based Information Systems (SBIS) are one of the best practices for addressing these constraints. The aim of the paper is to review the research on the applications of SBIS in data centers and discusses the opportunities for utilizing SBIS to support the business functions of the data centers including the management of cooling, power delivery and computing platforms. Although the use of sensors to monitor temperature, smoke, heat and security is considered an old practice in data centers, the full utilization and integration of these sensors into information systems to automate data centre management functions, inform decision making in data centre management and transform data centers to improve their operational, economic and environmental performance appears to be very limited. The paper reviews the current literature and concludes that there is a dearth for empirical studies that focus on the use of SBIS and the benefits of SBIS to the data centers. Thus, the paper calls for more theoretical and empirical research to investigate the utilization of SBIS to manage data centers’ platforms and its impact on data centers performance.},

  abstract   = {Cooling is an important issue in data center design and operation. Accurate evaluation of a design or operational parameter choice for cooling is difficult as it requires several runs of computationally intensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based models. Therefore there is need for an exploration method that does not incur enormous computation. In addition, the exploration should also provide insights that enable informed decision making. Given these twin goals of reduced computation and improved insights, we present a novel approach to data center cooling exploration. The key idea is to do a local search around the current design/operation of a data center to obtain better design/operation parameters subject to the desired constraints. To do this, all the microscopic information about airflow and temperature in data center available from a single run of CFD computation is converted into macroscopic metrics called influence indices. The influence indices, which characterize the causal relationship between heat sources and sinks, are used to refine the design/operation of the data center either manually or programmatically. New designs are evaluated with further CFD runs to compute new influence indices and the process is repeated to yield improved designs as per the computation budget available. We have carried out design exploration of a realistic data center using this methodology. Specifically, we considered maximization of the heat load in the data center subject to the constraints that: 1) servers are kept at appropriate temperatures and 2) overloading of CRACs is avoided. Our evaluation shows that the use of influence indices cuts down the exploration time by 80 % for a 1500 sq. ft. data center.},

Manipulating the inlet temperature to the servers can provide a possible method of lowering the operating cost of a data center. Conventional wisdom regarding management of the cold aisle temperature in the data center has traditionally been that colder temperatures kept the failure rate of the equipment down and higher temperatures reduced energy costs. While it is true that in most cooling strategies, increasing the cold aisle set point temperature reduces the power consumed by the facilities, the overall cost savings may not be realized due to increases in server power and decreased reliability. An investigation using the total operational expense of the data center would be required to find the optimum operating point of the environmental controls. The simulation described in this paper demonstrates that when accounting for total operational cost including component reliability and servicing in addition to energy and water resource costs, there is an optimal data center cold aisle set point. This point will vary with resource rates and climate variations. The run cost effectiveness metric, RCE, allows data center designers and managers to monitor and optimize their data center for the given static costs of the region. It's a measurable value for many data centers that can break out these costs either in real time, or more likely tabulated form collected from monitoring data over time.},

  abstract   = {Data centers consume a significant amount of energy in the US and worldwide, much of which is consumed by the cooling infrastructure, particularly the chiller plant and computer room air conditioners and air handlers. To enable energy efficient data center designs, ASHRAE added two new IT environmental classes, A3 and A4, with associated allowable inlet air temperatures of 40C and 45C respectively. IT equipment that meet these new allowable environmental envelopes can operate in data centers with minimal refrigeration cooling and instead rely on ambient free cooling. In this paper we investigate the impact of allowing a data center to operate up to the A3 limit of 40C on total data center energy use for 3 different types of servers in a chiller-less data center located in a variety of locations. The study finds that though facility power reduces as the demand for cold air reduces, the increase in IT power consumption, due to fan speed-up, can offset these savings and in some cases result in an overall increase in data center power. Thus the most energy efficient operating point is dependant on the specific energy use profiles of the infrastructure and the IT equipment. The higher allowable temperature can also result in higher failure rates and an increased risk of equipment or service loss due to data center cooling failures. This paper also presents a study on the potential for chiller elimination and chiller use reduction across the US, Europe and in India by operating in the various ASHRAE envelopes. For wet, water side economized data centers, A2 and A3 equipment is sufficient to almost completely remove the need for chillers in many geographic locations.},

Among the features of this system we outline: (-) average cost of each measurement point lower than 100 Euro (excluding the service platform); (-) negligible installation and maintenance costs; (-) long life (textgreater2 years, better 3) sensor node battery; (-) reliability, scalability and security; (-) self-configuring WSN. The architecture of the system consists of 4 layers: (-) a low cost set of sensor nodes deployed in each switching plant. Each node includes one or more sensors interfaced with a radio communication chip, compliant to Zigbee Standard; (-) a Gateway for each WSN, which acts as a data sink for the sensor nodes and which connects the WSN to the server platform through an internet connection (LAN or GSM-GPRS); (-) a service platform (WSN-C), able to manage and control different kinds of Sensor Networks (energy management, health care, automotive, ...), to collect and store data and to make them available to applications via a Web Service; (-) a web application which provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and data analysis facilities. The first trial started in April 2007 and demonstrated that an energy saving in the order of 10-15 % was possible by simply optimizing the air conditioning system working parameters.

Kaleidos is used not only to monitor and control the energy and thermal behaviour of si- - tes, but it has been shown to be effective in supporting the design of fine-grained energy saving actions and in real-time evaluation of those actions.

These indicators are based on energy consumption measurements, such as indexes of computing resource usage, of environmental impact, and even of development costs required to (re)design an application in order to optimise its energy consumption footprint, or of organizational factors related to application management. Our approach is framed in the GAMES (Green Active Management of Energy in IT Service centres) EU Project1 about green IT. In this paper, we define four clusters of Green Metrics enabling to feature an application in terms of the energy it consumes at run time. Such metrics are the basis for measuring the "greenness" of an application and to detect where it consumes and wastes energy. Hints are provided to improve applications design and execution. We show within an application scenario how monitoring and evaluation of the Green Metrics helps to improve energy efficiency.},

Today the term “reliability” is used as an umbrella definition covering a variety of subjects including availability, durability, quality and sometimes the function of the product. Reliability engineering was developed to quantify “how reliable” a component, product or system was when used in a specific application for a specific period of time. The data center industry has come to rely on “tier classifications” as presented in a number of papers by the Uptime Institute [1] as a gradient scale of data center configurations and requirements from least (Tier 1) to most reliable (Tier 4). This paper will apply the principles and modeling techniques of reliability engineering to specific examples that were selected based on gradient scale provided by the Tier Classifications and discuss the results. A review of the metrics of reliability engineering being used will also be included.},

Up to 60% of the energy consumed in a data center is used for cooling in wasteful ways as a result of lack of environmental information and overcompensated cooling systems. In this project, a wireless sensor network for data-enter environmental monitoring was developed to improve energy efficiency and to optimize data-center performance. The sensor network consists of a suite of sensor nodes for data sensing, a router node to relay sensed data, and a coordinator node to establish a network, receive the data, and process the data. The prototype sensor network was built on Arduino open source hardware with a seamlessly integrated XBee RF module and configured to operate within the ZigBee mesh network standard. A 24-hour test run at Argonne's data center demonstrated that the wireless networked environmental monitoring solution is easy to integrate and manage with the existing IT infrastructure, while delivering better visibility into the data center's 3D temperature and humidity distribution and substantial improvements in energy efficiency.},

The concept of accountability encompasses such practices, and is essential for enhancing security and trustworthiness in the cloud. Besides this, proper measurement of cloud services, both at a technical and governance level, is a distinctive aspect of the cloud computing model. Hence, a natural problem that arises is how to measure the impact on accountability of the procedures held in practice by organizations that participate in the cloud ecosystem. In this paper, we describe a metamodel for addressing the problem of measuring accountability properties for cloud computing, as discussed and defined by the Cloud Accountability Project (A4Cloud). The goal of this metamodel is to act as a language for describing: (i) accountability properties in terms of actions between entities, and (ii) metrics for measuring the fulfillment of such properties. It also allows the recursive decomposition of properties and metrics, from a high-level and abstract world to a tangible and measurable one. Finally, we illustrate our proposal of the metamodel by modelling the transparency property, and define some metrics for it.},

  abstract     = {The explosive development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has significantly enlarged both the energy demands and the CO 2 emissions, and consequently contributes to make the energy crisis and global warming problems worse. However, as the main force of the ICT field, the mobile networks, are currently focusing on the capacity, variety and stability of the communication services, without paying too much severe concerns on the energy efficiency. The escalating energy costs and environmental concerns have already created an urgent need for more energy-efficient ``green'' wireless communications. In this paper, we survey and discuss various remarkable techniques toward green mobile networks to date, mainly targeting mobile cellular networks. We also summarize the current research projects related to green mobile networks, along with the taxonomy of energy-efficiency metrics. We finally discuss and elaborate future research opportunities and design challenges for green mobile networks.},

  abstract     = {Reacting to the discussion on global warming, the HCI community has started to explore the design of tools to support responsible energy consumption. An important part of this research focuses on motivating energy savings by providing feedback tools which present consumption metrics interactively. In this line of work, the configuration of feedback has been mainly discussed using cognitive or behavioral factors. This narrow focus, however, misses a highly relevant perspective for the design of technology that supports sustainable lifestyles: to investigate the multiplicity of forms in which individuals or collectives actually consume energy. In this article, we broaden this focus, by taking a phenomenological lens to study how people use off-the-shelf eco-feedback systems in private households to make energy consumption accountable and explainable. By reconstructing accounting practices, we delineate several constitutive elements of the phenomenon of energy usage in daily life. We complement these elements with a description of the sophisticated methods used by people to organize their energy practices and to give a meaning to their energy consumption. We describe these elements and methods, providing examples coming from the fieldwork and uncovering observed strategies to account for consumption. Based on our results, we provide a critical perspective on existing eco-feedback mechanisms and describe several elements for a design rationale for designing support for responsible energy consumption. We argue that interactive feedback systems should not simply be an end, but rather a resource for the construction of the artful practice of making energy consumption accountable.},

  abstract  = {Integrating residential photovoltaic (PV) power generation and electrical energy storage (EES) systems into the Smart Grid is an effective way of utilizing renewable power and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. This has become a particularly interesting problem with the introduction of dynamic electricity energy pricing models since electricity consumers can use their PV-based energy generation and EES systems for peak shaving on their power demand profile from the grid, and thereby, minimize their electricity bill. Due to the characteristics of a realistic electricity price function and the energy storage capacity limitation, the control algorithm for a residential EES system should accurately account for various energy loss components during operation. Hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) systems are proposed to exploit the strengths of each type of EES element and hide its weaknesses so as to achieve a combination of performance metrics that is superior to those of any of its individual EES components. This paper introduces the problem of how best to utilize a HEES system for a residential Smart Grid user equipped with PV power generation facilities. The optimal control algorithm for the HEES system is developed, which aims at minimization of the total electricity cost over a billing period under a general electricity energy price function. The proposed algorithm is based on dynamic programming and has polynomial time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HEES system and optimal control algorithm achieves 73.9% average profit enhancement over baseline homogeneous EES systems.},

The computer application draws the appropriate graffiti on the canvas, which is positioned in front of the graffiter. Infrared camera provides detection of the light source for the application, which then correctly determines the color, size and density (the graffiter regulates these parameters through the speed buttons, which are located on the can) and in the end of this process, the current drawing track is projected on the canvas. The most important algorithms used in the implementation of the software solution are: an algorithm for locating the brightest area, the algorithm for the implementation of the drops and the algorithm for interpolation. Important component of simulation is also a Bluetooth connection to the Arduino BT platform, which is connected to three potentiometers. These are used by graffiter to manipulate painting parameters. The results of extensive tests have shown that the prototype has potential and that the final simulation perfectly follows the basic idea.

  abstract  = {Information Technology data centers consume a large amount of electricity in the US and world-wide. Cooling has been found to contribute about one third of this energy use. The two primary contributors to the data center cooling energy use are the refrigeration chiller and the Computer Room Air Conditioning units (CRACs). There have been recent changes in specifications for the data center environmental envelopes as mandated by ASHRAE (American Society for Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers), one of which specifically pertains to the upper and lower bound of air temperatures at the inlet to servers that are housed in data center rooms. These changes have been put in place in part to address the desire for greater cooling energy efficiency of these facilities. This paper primarily focuses on the methodologies to reduce the energy usage of room air conditioning devices by exploiting these recent changes in standards for the equipment environmental envelope. A 22000 square foot (6706 m2) data center with 739 kilo Watt of IT load is used as a representative example for numerical CFD analyses using a commercial software package to demonstrate methodologies to reduce the cooling energy use of Information Technology data centers. Several test case simulations are used to enable the calculation of room level air temperature fields for varying design conditions such as different numbers of operational CRACs or the volumetric air flow rate setting of the CRACs. Computation of cooling energy is carried out using available vendor equipment information. The relationship between the reduction in energy usage in CRAC units and the server inlet air temperatures are quantified and a systematic methodology for CRAC shut off is proposed. The relative magnitude of reduction in data center cooling energy use from shutting off CRACs or reducing CRAC motor speeds is also compared with scenarios involving increases in refrigeration chiller plant water temperatu- - re set point.},

We describe a substantial step towards this goal: a loosely-coupled, semi-automated thermal diagnosis system that integrates IT and facilities data, uses simple heuristics to highlight the most likely culprits, and provides a graphical interface that enables an administrator to narrow the list further by exploring data correlations. Among the challenges addressed by our solution are coping with heterogeneous data types and data access methods, and detecting and managing erroneous sensor readings.},

In the initialization stage the server is monitored for a specific period of time to collect energy consumption historical raw data for identifying associations between the server energy consumption states and the appropriate optimization actions. In the self-optimization stage, energy consumption server state snapshots are taken at regular time intervals and formally represented using a biologically-inspired antigen model. The obtained antigen is then classified as self (optimal energy consumption state) or non-self (non-optimal energy consumption state) using a set of detectors obtained in the initialization stage. For non-self antigens a biologically-inspired clonal selection approach is used to determine the actions that need to be taken to bring the server in an optimal energy consumption state.},

Unfortunately, existing methods for energy metering in multicores fail to provide accurate energy estimates for each task when several tasks run simultaneously. This article makes a case for accurate Per-Task Energy Metering (PTEM) based on tracking the resource utilization and occupancy of each task. Different hardware implementations with different trade-offs between energy prediction accuracy and hardware-implementation complexity are proposed. Our evaluation shows that the energy consumed in a multicore by each task can be accurately measured. For a 32-core, 2-way, simultaneous multithreaded core setup, PTEM reduces the average accuracy error from more than 12% when our hardware support is not used to less than 4% when it is used. The maximum observed error for any task in the workload we used reduces from 58% down to 9% when our hardware support is used.},

  abstract  = {Currently smart meter data analytics has received enormous attention because it allows utility companies to analyze customer consumption behavior in real time. However, the amount of data generated by these sensors is very large. As a result, analytics performed on top of it become very expensive. Furthermore, smart meter data contains very detailed energy consumption measurement which can lead to customer privacy breach and all risks associated with it. In this work, we address the problem on how to reduce smart meter data numerosity and its detailed measurement while maintaining its analytics accuracy. We convert the data into symbolic representation and allow various machine learning algorithms to be performed on top of it. In addition, our symbolic representation admit an additional advantage to allow also algorithms which usually work on nominal and string to be run on top of smart meter data. We provide an experiment for classification and forecasting tasks using real-world data. And finally, we illustrate several directions to extend our work further.},

The SEMS not only supplies power as the way the common power strips do but also controls sockets of the SEMS using ZigBee wireless communication. A test bed for experiment consists of a motion sensor, the SEMS and three appliances which are connected to the SEMS and the experiment was conducted for five days to measure the power consumption of three appliances with regard to both functions. The experimental result shows that the power consumption of the SEMS with two functions is considerably reduced when compared with the power consumption of the common power strip.},
